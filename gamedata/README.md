This folder contains all of the default gamedata files.

For now they are json, but hey, what can ya do

<br/>

The default json files, that should not be altered, are `main.json` in each folder.

Adding any other json files will make the game load them and attempt to use them, you can use that for modding.

<br/>

Any non json files should be ignored, just maybe don't test that.
